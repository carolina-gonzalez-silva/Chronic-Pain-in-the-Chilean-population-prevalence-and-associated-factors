# Chronic-Pain-in-the-Chilean-population-prevalence-and-associated-factors

Abstract

Chronic pain (CP) has been established as a key factor in the aging process. However, there remains a substantial gap in understanding the prevalence of CP in Chile, its associated factors, and its correlation with cognitive decline in elderly people. This study utilized data from the Chilean population, collected from the 2009-2010 and 2016-2017 National Health Surveys (NHS). We analyzed the prevalence of CP, exploring associated factors as well as the correlation between CP and cognitive impairment among Chileans aged 60 years and above. The overall prevalence of CP was 46.0% in the 2009-2010 NHS and 28.9% in the 2016-2017 NHS. CP prevalence increased with age, ranging from 26.6% among individuals aged 15-24 years to 59.9% among those aged 65-80 years in the 2009-2010 NHS, and from 16.6% to 40.2% in the 2016-2017 NHS. Females consistently reported higher CP rates, with prevalence two or more times greater than that of males. Logistic regression analyses identified several factors associated with CP, including reduced mobility, depression, anxiety, socioeconomic disadvantage, and lower educational attainment. Moreover, aging, female sex, socioeconomic disadvantage, and lower educational attainment were significant predictors of CP. There was no significant difference in CP prevalence between individuals with and without cognitive impairment; however, our study revealed that individuals with cognitive decline tended to experience pain in a greater number of anatomical sites. This study is the first to consider factors such as age, income, mood, mobility, diet, and cognitive skills in Chileans dealing with CP.
